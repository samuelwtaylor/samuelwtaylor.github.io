<h2>
What my project was about and why i chose to do it
</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
For my project, I chose to do photography and editing and I have worked out that I am not the best at taking 
photos so I can improve with that and I might do another photography project in the future.
</p>

<h2>
What i did with for my first photo
</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
The first photo I took and edited of me dunking a basketball and all I did to edit this photo was just 
changed the sharpness the exposure and also the contrast.
</p>

<h2>
My second photo
</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
Then for my second picture I did one that was pretty similar to the last one this was a picture of a basketball hoop and I just 
changed the exposure the sharpness and I made it a bit more orange. 
</p>

<h2>
My third and best photo
</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
My third picture was definitely the
hardest and more complex thing to edit this one I tried to show movement 
in my photo so I took a burst shot which is just like taking a series of photos one after another. After I 
took them I went and basically staked them up and erased part of the one on top of the picture I wanted to 
show and I repeated this until I got all five of the same person in the one picture I also darkened the 
background and made four of the figures more transparent so that you would focus on the figure closest to 
the hoop.
